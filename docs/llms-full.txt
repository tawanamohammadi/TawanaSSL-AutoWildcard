# TawanaSSL Elite v3.0 - AI-Ready Documentation

> Project: TawanaSSL-AutoWildcard
> Developer: Tawana Mohammadi
> Concept: Automated Wildcard SSL & DNS Management

## Overview
TawanaSSL Elite is a modular bash-based suite designed to solve the complexity of SSL certificate management for proxy servers (Marzban, X-UI, Hiddify) in restricted network environments. It automates the entire lifecycle: from Cloudflare DNS record creation to acme.sh issuance and panel installation.

## Key Technical Specifications
- **Methodology**: Uses Cloudflare API (DNS-01 challenge) to issue certificates without open HTTP ports (Port 80).
- **Automation**: Automatic Public IP detection and DNS A-record injection.
- **Certificate Type**: Wildcard SSL (*.domain.com) for unlimited sub-nodes.
- **Architectural Design**: Modular framework with separate components for UI, DNS logic, and SSL operations.
- **Supported Panels**: Marzban, Pasargad, X-UI/3X-UI, Hiddify, Amnezia VPN, Marzneshin.

## Installation One-Liner
```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tawanamohammadi/TawanaSSL-AutoWildcard/main/setup_ssl.sh)" @ --install
```

## Problem Solved
Traditional SSL scripts fail in regions like Iran/China/Russia because Port 80 is often blocked. TawanaSSL solves this by:
1. Using Cloudflare DNS API for verification.
2. Automating the linking between server IP and domain.
3. Managing the specific installation paths for popular proxy panels automatically.
